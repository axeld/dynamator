<title>Dynamator Example 6: If</title>

<h1>If</h1>

<p>This example shows how to conditionally output HTML elements at
run-time.</p>

<p>The goal of Dynamator is to separate program logic from HTML.
The separation is two-way: no program logic in the HTML, and no
HTML in the program logic. By completely decoupling program logic
from HTML, both can change independently.</p>

<p>When the presence of an HTML element depends on a dynamic value,
or the actual element changes depending on a dynamic value, it is
very tempting to put the HTML element in a dynamic component such
as a Java class or a Dynamator file. Resist that temptation; it
would make the dynamic component less reusable and increase the
maintenance burden on the Java developer if the HTML needs to
change.</p>

<p>Conditional processing allows the presence or absence of an
element to be determined at run-time. To enable conditional
processing, add an 'if' element subordinate to the corresponding
'id' or 'class' element in the Dynamator file. The content of the
'if' element is a boolean program expression. At run-time, if the
property or expression evaluates to 'true', the HTML element and
its children are output. If the property or expression evaluates to
'false', the HTML element and its children are not output.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<table class="tabular" summary="conditional example">
<tr>
<td class="dyn">&lt;id name="conditional"&gt;<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;if&gt;<i>booleanExpression</i>&lt;if&gt;<br />
 &lt;/id&gt;</td>
<td>Outputs the element with the id 'conditional', and its children,
only if the java expression evaluates to true.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The example below is similar to the TextEcho example.
Instead of entering text, the user selects an option from a choice
list. When the page is redisplayed, the choice list is set to the
choice the user made, and an appropriate sentence is displayed. This
example is trivial, and in real life it would be implemented
differently, but it allows us to consider conditional logic
independently of everything else.</p>

<p>Unlike the TextEcho example, this example does not use Javascript.
This allows us to demonstrate another useful technique for static demo
site construction, CSS element hiding.</p>

<h2>Page</h2>

<iframe width="600" height="170" src="TrueFalse.html"></iframe>

<h2>HTML</h2>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">TrueFalse.html (updated for
Dynamator)</div>

<div class="html">
<div class='insert'>TrueFalse_original.html</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each select option is given its own id as a hook so that the
'selected' option can be programmatically determined.</li>

<li>A &lt;div&gt; element has been added around the response text
to provide a hook for program logic. Conditional logic will be
added to the &lt;div&gt; element in the Dynamator file so that the
response text will only be output in response to a submit.</li>

<li>Each response value is in the HTML. The response value that is
displayed is chosen at run-time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Placing each response value in the HTML has a benefit and a
disadvantage. The benefit is that the HTML author can control the
HTML for each response value. The disadvantage is that when the
HTML page is displayed as-is (i.e. for a demo or by the HTML
author), each response value is displayed, unless some extra HTML
coding is done.</p>

<p>Unwanted elements can be rendered invisible for a demo using CSS.
The following example shows how:</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">TrueFalse.html (updated for
demo)</div>

<div class="html">
<div class='insert'>TrueFalse.html</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Two things have been added. The first is a CSS style preventing the
display of any element with the class "HideForDemo".
The second is the association of one of the alternative output elements
with that class.</p>

<p>Typically, a style such as "HideForDemo" is placed in the
application's main stylesheet, but not used in the production application.
</p>

<h2>Dynamator File</h2>

<p>The following Dynamator file corresponds to the demo example
above.</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">TrueFalse.dyn</div>

<div class="dyn">
<div class='insert'>TrueFalse.dyn</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>The Dynamator &lt;if&gt; element can be used with any locator or
attribute. It causes the located element or attribute to be output only
if the program expression specified in the content of the element
evaluates to true at run-time.</p>

<p>The Dynamator file above causes the 'response' element to be output
only if the query string contains a value.  Note that this applies to
the entire element, not just the start and end tags.  
The Dynamator file also adds the 'selected' attribute to whichever
options element matches the current selection, and causes only the text
matching the current selection to be output.</p>

<h2>JSP File</h2>

<p>After processing with Dynamator, the resulting JSP file looks
like this:</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">TrueFalse.jsp (generated by
Dynamator)</div>

<iframe src="TrueFalse_jsp.html" width="600" height="250" frameborder="1" scrolling="auto"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Note the spacing in the two options tags. The reason there is no
space between the value attribute and the '&lt;%' is that in HTML
it is not valid to have a space before the '&gt;' of the end of the
tag.</p>

<div class="in-action">
<h2>In Action</h2>

<p>If you are viewing this page in a servlet engine, you can see <a
href="TrueFalse.jsp">the generated page in action</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Observations</h2>

<p>Obviously, using an 'if' for each option in an option list is
not a maintainable approach. In most cases, an option list merits a
'foreach', discussed later.</p>
