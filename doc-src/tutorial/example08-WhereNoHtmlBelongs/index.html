<h1>Applying behavior where HTML elements don't belong</h1>

<p>In every example so far we've used HTML elements as hooks to add
dynamic behavior. But there are several cases where HTML elements
are not usually available. Two examples are Scripts and
preformatted text blocks.</p>

<p>This example shows how to add dynamic behavior where there is no
HTML element. There's no magic; you'll need to add an HTML element
to do it. The trick is in retaining the ability of the HTML source
file to be displayed correctly in a browser.</p>

<p>This example revisits the Text Echo Example, enhancing it by
adding a JavaScript edit and displaying the previously entered
value within a "pre" element.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of modifications you're likely to want to
be able to make to scripts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set a variable value within a script. There is a trick to this
that this example demonstrates.</li>

<li>Remove the script completely. To remove script code with
Dynamator, the script code to be removed must be in its own script
element. Then you can use normal Dynamator behavior to locate the
element and remove it. Often you can just give the script element a
class attribute with value "Discard". (Note that this is not valid
HTML, but neither Tidy nor browsers will complain.)</li>

<li>Replace script code with different script code. To replace
script code with Dynamator, the script code to be replaced must be
in its own script element. Then you can use normal Dynamator
behavior to locate the element and replace it. Replacing script
code programmatically might be bad form; it might be better to use
a design that relies on either variable setting or script
removal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Page</h2>

<iframe width="600" height="170" src="TextEcho2.html"></iframe>

<h2>HTML</h2>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">TextEcho2.html (updated)</div>

<div class="html">
<div class='insert'>TextEcho2.html</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>The code for this example actually simulates the behavior of the
JSP form using JavaScript. Both the simulation and the "real" form
require a JavaScript variable to hold the value the user just
entered.</p>

<p>The source for the variable value is different depending on
whether the page is being used as a static demo or as the final
JSP. To do this, place each variable definition within its own
script element. The script for the demo variable initialization is
placed after the script to be used in production so that the demo
initialization is used when the page is used as a demo, and given
class="Discard" so that it is omitted when Dynamator generates the
JSP.</p>

<p>Within the variable initialization script to be included in the
JSP, place a span element where the variable's initial value will
be supplied. Add a class attribute with the value 'DiscardTag' to
cause Dynamator to omit the span tag from the generated JSP, but
include the content of the element. The Dynamator file will specify
an override for the content of this element.</p>

<p>The syntax of the span tag is different than we have seen
before. A close tag is not used; instead the tag ends with "/&gt;".
Within a &lt;script&gt; element with language="javascript", if the
close tag is used, JTidy emits it as "&lt;\/span&gt;", which breaks
the xml parser.</p>

<p>This example also includes a script to output the value of the
variable. Since we want this value hard-coded in the JSP output
page, the script is given the class "DiscardTag" so that only the
contents of the script element will be included in the generated
JSP. Because the script element has the same 'id' attribute value
as the variable initialization, its contents will be replaced with
the same value as the variable.</p>

<p>We used the same 'id' attribute value twice in this example.
Browsers aren't complaining yet, but it might be better to use the
class attribute instead.</p>

<h2>Dynamator File</h2>

<p>The Dynamator file is the same as in the previous TextEcho
example.</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">TextEcho2.dyn</div>

<div class="dyn">
<div class='insert'>TextEcho2.dyn</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>For line-oriented languages like JavaScript, if the raw-content
element is used to supply the value, the entire element should be
all on the same line so that the resulting code doesn't add line
breaks.</p>

<p>It's important to replace or remove all span elements that occur
within scripts. A span element that is not removed will be output
as "&lt;span ...&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"; which is invalid (because of
the '&lt;/' sequence) and probably not what you want anyway.</p>

<p>Although this example doesn't demonstrate this, it's good
practice to remove any 'id' or 'class' attributes added to script
tags, since they are not valid HTML.</p>

<h2>JSP</h2>

<p>After processing with Dynamator, the resulting JSP file looks
like this:</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">TextEcho2.jsp (generated by
Dynamator)</div>

<iframe src="TextEcho2_jsp.html" class="out" width="600" height="250" frameborder="1" scrolling="auto"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Note that the 'span' element and the last script element do not
appear in the generated JSP file, because they were given the class
'DiscardTag'.</p>

<p>Although the indentation appears broken within the 'pre'
element; it's necessary to omit indentation in order to ensure that
the content of the 'pre' element is formatted correctly.</p>

<div class="in-action">
<h2>In Action</h2>

<p>If you are viewing this page in a servlet engine, you can see <a
href="TextEcho2.jsp">the generated page in action</a>.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
