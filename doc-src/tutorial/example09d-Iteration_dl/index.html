<title>Dynamator Example 9d: Creating Dynamically Populated
Dictionary Lists</title>

<h1>Dictionary Lists</h1>

<p>This example shows how to output the elements of a dictionary or
properties object as a dictionary list. Dictionary lists are
different from the previously covered repeated HTML elements
because for each element of a collection, two HTML elements are
repeated.</p>

<h2>Page</h2>

<p>This example is a page that shows the current system properties
values:</p>

<iframe width="600" height="170" src="SystemProperties.html"></iframe>

<h2>HTML</h2>

<p>To repeat dictionary entries for each element of an indexed
property, add a 'class' attribute to the 'dl' element. Note that
this is different from the table example, in which the 'class'
attribute was added to the repeating element. This is because 'dl'
has two repeating elements.</p>

<p>It might seem like a good idea to put a 'div' element around a
'dt/dd' element pair, but that's not valid HTML.</p>

<p>The 'dt' and 'dd' elements must also be given a 'class'
attribute.</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">SystemProperties.html</div>

<div class="html">
<div class='insert'>SystemProperties.html</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<h2>Dynamator File</h2>

<p>When iterating over a dictionary list, the 'foreach' attribute
must be applied to the 'dl' element. If applied to the 'dt' and
'dd' elements, all the 'dt' elements would be together, followed by
all the 'dd' elements.</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">SystemProperties.dyn</div>

<div class="dyn">
<div class='insert'>SystemProperties.dyn</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>For Properties and Dictionary objects, the 'element' variable
refers to the value part of an entry. For a Properties object, the
name of the variable referring to the key part of an entry is the
element variable name followed by "Name". For a Dictionary object,
the name of the variable referring to the key part of an entry is
the element variable name followed by "Key".</p>

<h2>JSP file</h2>

<p>After processing with Dynamator, the resulting JSP file looks
like this:</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">SystemProperties.jsp (generated by
Dynamator)</div>

<iframe width="600" height="250" src="SystemProperties_jsp.html" frameborder="1" scrolling="auto"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<div class="in-action">
<h2>In Action</h2>

<p>If you are viewing this page in a servlet engine, you can see <a
href="SystemProperties.jsp">the generated page in action</a>.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
