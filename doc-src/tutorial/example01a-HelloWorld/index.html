<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>This example shows how to use Dynamator to create the simplest
possible dynamic page.</p>

<h2>The Page</h2>

<iframe width="600" height="170" src="HelloWorld.html"></iframe>

<h2>Step 1: Create an HTML file</h2>

<p>In the development process Dynamator was designed to support, HTML
authors create and maintain a static demo site. A static demo site is
a browser-based UI prototype of the application to be built, complete
with sample data. Most web application development processes
recommend the creation of such a prototype. Projects that do create
such a prototype usually throw it away. With Dynamator, the prototype
becomes a maintainable portion of the application.</p>

<p>In Dynamator terminology, the HTML file is called a "template"
file.</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">HelloWorld.html</div>

<div class="html">
<div class='insert'>HelloWorld_original.html</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<h2>Step 2: Update the HTML file to identify elements requiring 
server-side behavior</h2>

<p>For each element within the HTML file that requires server-side
behavior, add an 'id' attribute. (Subsequent lessons will present other
ways to identify elements.) The 'id' attribute is a standard
attribute in HTML 4.0 that can be added to any element for which 
dynamic behavior makes sense. The format of the 'id' attribute is:</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="html">&lt;<i>tag</i>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<b>
id="single-exclusive-name"</b>&nbsp;...&gt;</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>The ID attribute value must contain exactly one name. That name
must be used as an ID only once in the entire HTML document.
(Later, we will discuss use of the 'class' attribute, which may
contain multiple names that can be used in multiple places in the
HTML document.)</p>

<p>In the example below, the change made for this step is in <b>
bold</b>.</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">HelloWorld.html (updated)</div>

<div class="html">
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p <b>id="DynamicText"</b>&gt;Hello world
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>This change could be performed by an HTML developer or a Java
developer. Even if performed by a Java developer, the resulting file
could be returned to the HTML development organization for
maintenance, because the file contains only standard HTML.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Create a Dynamator File</h2>

<p>The Dynamator file provides the dynamic behavior for the HTML
page. It contains two kinds of information. First, it contains the
page prolog. This is the jsp code that is placed before any text
from the HTML file. Second, it contains the dynamic behavior for
elements marked with an 'id' attribute.</p>

<p>Dynamator assumes that the name of the mapping file matches the
name of the html file, with a suffix of '.dyn'.</p>

<p>You may find this file a bit overwhelming at first glance. It's
really simpler than it looks. The XML syntax makes it look more
complicated than it really is, just because XML is so verbose.</p>

<p>One of the nice things about this file is that the data it
carries is ideally suited for tool support. It wouldn't be too hard
to simplify the syntax using a preprocessor. With more effort,
imagine a drag-and-drop tool that links class attributes to html
fields and stores the linkage in this file.</p>

<p>After you get a look at the whole thing we'll take one part at a
time.</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">HelloWorld.dyn</div>

<div class="dyn">
<div class='insert'>HelloWorld.dyn</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<h3>The Root Node</h3>

<p>The root node of the Dynamator file is the <span class="dyn">
dynamator</span> element. The file must start and end as
follows:</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="dyn">
<pre>
&lt;dynamator language="jsp"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/dynamator&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<h3>The Prolog</h3>

<p>If the Dynamator file contains a prolog section (most will), the
prolog is placed at the beginning of the generated JSP file. The
prolog usually contains a bunch of JSP elements.</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="dyn">
<pre>
  &lt;prolog&gt;
    &lt;%@ page session="false" %&gt;
    &lt;%!
        private String getGreeting()
        {
            return "Hello World, says Dynamator!";
        }
    %&gt;
  &lt;/prolog&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Everything within the prolog is normal JSP. The first directive
tells the JSP engine not to access a session for this page. The
declaration block defines a method for use from within the page. In
<a href="../example01b-HelloWorld_Bean/index.html">another version
of this example</a> we'll show use of the &lt;jsp:useBean&gt;
element.</p>

<h3>ID mappings</h3>

<p>The remainder of the Dynamator file maps id attribute value
names in the html file to dynamic behavior.</p>

<div class="twocolumn">
<div class="column-filename">HTML</div>

<div class="html">
<pre>
&lt;p id="<b>DynamicText</b>"&gt;
<b>Hello world</b>
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="twocolumn">
<div class="column-filename">Dynamator file</div>

<div class="dyn">
<pre>
  &lt;id name="<b>DynamicText</b>"&gt;
    &lt;content&gt;<b>getGreeting()</b>&lt;/content&gt;
  &lt;/id&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>For each 'id' attribute in the HTML for which server-side
behavior is desired, there must be an 'id' element in the
Dynamator file. The element must have a name attribute with a value
matching the value of the id attribute in the HTML file (in this
case, "DynamicText"). (The HTML file may contain elements with 'id'
attributes for which no mapping exists, and the Dynamator file may
contain 'id' elements for which there is no counterpart in the HTML
file.)</p>

<p>The Dynamator file specifies how to transform the HTML template into
a server page.  Transformations are associated with HTML elements
through "locators".  The Dynamator file's 'id' element is a locator; it
matches any template element with an 'id' attribute having the same
value.</p>

<p>For any locator, there can be multiple "modifiers".  A modifier
specifies the changes to be made to located elements.  In this case
there is just one: the content of the element is replaced with a Java
expression. The "content" modifier directs Dynamator to replace the
content of the located element with a program expression. In
this case, the content will be replaced with the Java expression
"getGreeting()".</p>

<p>The content of an element &lt;<b>x</b>&gt; is everything between
the &lt;x&gt; and the matching &lt;/x&gt;. In HTML, not all tags
require a matching close-tag. In our example, the &lt;p&gt; tag
does not have a matching close-tag. In such a case, the content
ends in the place where the matching close-tag is implied. To
determine where that would be, you can examine the Tidy output.</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">Tidy output</div>

<div class="html">
<pre>
&lt;p id="DynamicText"&gt;
Hello world
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<h2>Step 4: Run dynamate</h2>

<p>Now that we have an HTML template and a Dynamator file, 
the <b>dynamate</b> command can be executed to create the JSP file.</p>

<p>The <b>dynamate</b> command is run on the template file.
Dynamator locates the Dynamator file for a given template by finding a
file with the same base name, with the suffix ".dyn".</p>

<div class="shell">
<pre>
.../doc/tutorial/example01a_HelloWorld&gt; <b>java dynamate HelloWorld.html</b>

Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing "HelloWorld.html"

HelloWorld.html: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
HelloWorld.html: Document content looks like HTML 4.01 Transitional
no warnings or errors were found
</pre>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Because the input file is HTML, Dynamator uses <a
href="http://jtidy.sourceforge.net">JTidy</a> to normalize the HTML file
to valid XML, producing a file called "HelloWorld.asxml".  Dynamator
then applies the Dynamator file to the XML file to produce
"HelloWorld.jsp".</p>

<p>Dynamator is essentially a specialized XML file editor. 
It's sort of a cross between sed and xslt, with a minimal set of
target-language-specific bindings.
Dynamator does <b>not</b> have any understanding of the target language,
so it can't catch programming errors.</p>

<p>Dynamator's role in the development lifecycle is to automate the
transformation of templates into server pages or programs. In 
conventional web application development, software developers manually
transform HTML pages into some server-side technology. With Dynamator,
software developers specify the transformation, then let Dynamator do
the work as the HTML evolves.</p>

<h2>Generated JSP file</h2>

<p>The above command produces the following file. Changes to the
original HTML are <span class="dyn-inline">highlighted</span>.</p>

<div class="column">
<div class="column-filename">HelloWorld.jsp (generated by
Dynamator)</div>

<iframe src="HelloWorld_jsp.html" width="600" height="250" frameborder="1" scrolling="auto"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>This file contains the prolog, followed by the HTML page. The
content of the 'p' element that contains the 'id' attribute has
been replaced by a JSP expression to access the 'greeting' property
of the Java object referred to by variable 'subject'.</p>

<p>The HTML file has been changed somewhat by the translation;
these changes do not affect the appearance of the page. In addition
to the highlighted changes, the output has been reformatted so that
indentation matches the level of element nesting. Most importantly
for this example, Tidy added a close-paragraph tag at the
appropriate location.</p>

<div class="in-action">
<h2>In Action</h2>

<p>If you are viewing this page in a servlet engine, you can see <a
href="HelloWorld.jsp">the generated page in action</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Observations</h2>

<p>This example has shown the two essential kinds of files used to
create a server page or program using Dynamator (the HTML file and the
Dynamator file), what simple files would look like, and how to use
Dynamator to create a JSP page.</p>

<p>Whether the Model I or Model II JSP programming model is used,
Dynamator adds one file, the Dynamator file. Although this adds a
level of indirection for maintainers, the value it provides is that
it separates all programming logic from the HTML.</p>

<p>This complete separation simplifies development and provides
additional value, such as the ability to maintain a static demo site
that can be automatically transformed into a production app.</p>
