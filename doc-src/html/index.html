      Dynamator is a simple but powerful tool that transforms 
      standard HTML and XML files into server pages or programs.
      Dynamator was created to solve the 
      <a href="problem.html">Server Pages Maintenance Problem</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dynamator separates HTML from program logic so completely 
      that different page generation technologies can use the
      same HTML.
      With Dynamator, software developers don't have to maintain
      HTML, and HTML authors don't have to learn a programming
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dynamator works with any page generation technology, 
      including JSP, XSL, PHP, ASP, Velocity, Cold Fusion, and
      Java.
      Dynamator is compatible with any application architecture,
      and has no performance impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dynamator isn't just for web applications.  It's a great
      tool for any application that needs to generate HTML or 
      template-based XML.
    </p>

      Dynamator is distributed under a BSD-style open-source
      license.
