      The Server Pages Maintenance Problem
    </h1>
    <p>
      Server pages are fundamentally unmaintainable because they
      combine code that should be developed and maintained by
      people in two different roles with two different skill
      sets.

    <h2>
      <a name="separationmyth">Page Generation Technologies Don't
      Separate</a> 
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every page generation technology claims to separate program
      logic from HTML. But there's a simple test for separation,
      and nearly every page generation technology fails the test:
    </p>
    <p
    style="text-align:center; margin-left: 15%; margin-right:15%;">
      Does the technology require the same file to contain both
      server-side program code and client-side page content?
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of how technology providers may define
      "separation", this is the definition that matters most. Any file
      that needs to be maintained by people in two different
      roles is not maintainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simplifying the programming language doesn't solve the
      problem. Assuming that a simpler language enables
      non-programmers to program is like assuming that a simple
      painting program confers artistic skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using an HTML-like syntax doesn't solve the problem. A
      programming language that looks like HTML is still a
      programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enhancing HTML with a small set of language extensions
      doesn't solve the problem. Although fewer is better, even
      one non-standard HTML construct means that the resulting
      file is not standard HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, server pages technologies and template
      languages are designed to <b>combine</b> program logic and
      static content, not to separate them.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="effects">The Effects of Non-Separation</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Combining server-side code with client-side content causes
      problems for HTML authors, software developers, and the
      organizations that employ them.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <a name="effectsOnHTMLAuthors">Effects on HTML authors</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      HTML authors have difficulty working with server pages
      because they are not HTML:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Server pages usually don't display correctly in browsers,
        so HTML authors have to deploy them to a server to see
        the effects of their changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Server pages are incompatible with most HTML authoring
        tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        Server pages usually can't be validated by HTML
        validators.
      </li>
      <li>
        Server pages have program logic that an HTML author has
        to wade around.
      </li>
      <li>
        Server pages that use a language (like taglibs) similar
        to HTML can be very confusing, especially when the
        language provides elements that are just slightly
        different from standard HTML.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Claims that server pages are designed to be maintained by
      HTML authors are completely unfounded. Even when a
      programming language is made to look like HTML, HTML
      authors still need to learn the semantics of the language.
      This is a much larger task than most programmers realize.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are HTML authors who can maintain server pages, just
      as there are programmers who can paint. But assuming that
      all HTML authors can maintain server pages is as invalid as
      assuming that all programmers can paint.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <a name="effectsOnDevelopers">Effects on Software Developers</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Few software developers consider server pages a problem, at
      first. Software developers enjoy challenges, so complexity
      doesn't bother them. Software developers relish new
      technologies, and server pages have seen more than their
      share. And server pages (or their older cousins, template
      languages) are certainly superior to programs that embed
      static content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem for software developers is much more subtle.
      The problem is that software developers usually end up
      maintaining the HTML in server pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now any software developer is capable of maintaining HTML.
      But few software developers aspire to be HTML authors. And
      the rate of change to the static content of most
      commercially produced web applications is so high that
      server page developers can spend most of their time
      tweaking HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      That wasn't the theory. The theory was that HTML authors
      would maintain the HTML. But in practice, once HTML has
      been converted to server pages, software developers
      typically own the server page.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <a name="effectsOnOrganizations">Problems for Organizations</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The problems caused by combining server-side logic with
      client-side content worsen when HTML and program logic are
      created by two different organizations or companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      An organization responsible for HTML development does not
      want to support every possible page generation technology.
      The changes in JSP syntax alone over the past few years
      have been much greater than the changes in HTML. Nor would
      such an organization want to be held accountable for
      introducing programming errors, since it doesn't have the
      means to test for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      An organization responsible for server pages development
      probably does not want to export program logic to a
      different organization responsible for HTML. Nor would such
      an organization want to be held accountable for programming
      errors that might have been introduced by the
      HTML-producing organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both kinds of organizations are less efficient than they 
      could be.  The organization responsible for server pages
      development bears the larger burden, since it is employing
      software developers to fill essentially HTML authoring roles.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <a name="effectsOnQuality">Effects on Product Quality</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Because server page source code is less testable than pure HTML,
      quality is more difficult to achieve.
      Browser compatibility testing, standards compliance validation,
      and accessibility validation are all much easier with pure HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because this kind of testing is repetitive, time-consuming, and
      tedious, it tends to not be performed by programmers, who own
      server pages code.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="engineering">A Software Engineering View</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The combination of server-side code with client-side
      content violates a basic software engineering principle:
      modularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's bad enough that server pages interpose two (or more)
      languages that execute at different times and places with
      different execution models.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real problem is that a single file contains code that
      should be developed and maintained by people in two
      different roles with two different skill sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is so fundamental a violation of modularity that it is
      not even addressed in the software engineering literature.
      David Parnas gets as close as anyone in his classic
      article, <a href="http://www.acm.org/classics/may96"
      style="font-style:italic">On the Criteria to be used in
      Decomposing Systems into Modules</a>, when he states that
      one benefit of modularity is that "development time should
      be shortened because separate groups would work on each
      module with little need for communication."

    <h2>
      <a name="solution">Dynamator: A Solution to Separation</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dynamator was invented specifically to solve the 
      Server Pages Maintenance Problem.
      With Dynamator, server-side code and client-side content are
      stored in separate files so they can be maintained independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Dynamator, HTML authors can maintain pure, standard HTML
      even after a site goes live.  
      Pure HTML is much easier to work with than server pages.
      It is easily validated, and 
      can be tested in a browser without deploying to a server.
      With Dynamator, HTML authors are more productive.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Dynamator, software developers don't even have to touch
      HTML.  
      Instead, they maintain Dynamator files, which specify how to 
      transform an HTML file into a server page.
      Dynamator provides a loosely coupled HTML interface,
      making server code much more resilient to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Dynamator, teams and applications become more agile.
      HTML is decoupled from server code, and server code dependencies
      on HTML are minimized, with the result that HTML authors and
      software developers can work in parallel with minimal
      interactions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dynamator's approach to separation has other benefits beyond just
      solving the Server Pages Maintenance Problem.
      For example, server code can be modularized to enable a high
      degree of reuse. 
      And architects are free to choose the right technology for the job: 
      it's as easy to use Dynamator to generate Java servlets as it is
      to generate JSP.
