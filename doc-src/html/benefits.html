      Benefits
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>More effective teams.</b><br />
         HTML authors don't have to be trained to program. They
        never even see any non-standard HTML tags or program
        logic. So they can focus on faithful design rendering,
        browser compatibility, accessibility, and tweaks.<br />
        <br />
         Software developers don't have to spend time tweaking
        HTML for a page they happen to be working on. They can
        treat HTML as a white-box module with a well-defined
        interface. Dynamator files are much easier for software
        developers to maintain than server pages.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Faster development and maintainance.</b><br />
         Dynamator allows HTML authors to work on HTML at the
        same time that programmers are working on server page
        code. Changes implemented in parallel are integrated in
        seconds by Dynamator.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Increased client satisfaction.</b><br />
         Clients like to tweak HTML. In typical projects, the
        tweaking never stops. With traditional technologies,
        tweaking is very costly after HTML has been converted to
        server pages. With Dynamator, clients can tweak all they
        want without affecting the critical path. HTML authors
        can apply tweaks to the static demo site, providing
        rapid, tangible feedback at low cost. Then the updated
        demo site can be quickly transformed into the production
        site using Dynamator.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Easier testing.</b><br />
         Because HTML remains pure, it can be viewed in a
        browser. No need for page authors to deploy server pages
        to a web server to see what they will look like.<br />
        <br />
         Because Dynamator allows the same program logic file to
        be used by multiple templates, software developers can
        write XML templates to test server page program logic
        behavior apart from HTML.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Simpler separation.</b><br />
         Many complications have been introduced to web
        application architectures in attempts to separate static
        content from program logic. Few really accomplish that
        objective.<br />
        <br />
         Dynamator makes separation easy: server code is kept in
        a separate file. Revisit your assumptions: for a simple
        site, you might not need an MVC architecture, tag
        libraries, or even JavaBeans; Dynamator alone might
        provide sufficient modularity with greatly reduced
        development effort.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Easy reuse.</b><br />
         Dynamator files are automatically reusable. So each
        Dynamator file becomes part of a library of reusable
        server code. Because Dynamator files contain no HTML,
        they can be reused wherever the same behavior is needed,
        even when formatting is drastically different.<br />
        <br />
         Dynamator libraries are much easier to build than JSP
        tag libraries because library components are normal
        Dynamator files.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Smoother organizational interfaces.</b><br />
         Server pages are at their worst when HTML and server
        code are produced by different organizations. By
        providing a crisp interface between HTML and server code,
        Dynamator simplifies and structures the relationship
        between producing organizations. Each organization
        remains in complete control of its portion of the work,
        and is free from responsibility for work owned by the
        other organization.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improved internationalization.</b><br />
         Nothing can make internationalization easy, but
        Dynamator offers compelling advantages over traditional
        approaches. Dynamator can reduce the cost and complexity
        of both architecture development and the
        internationalization and localization processes. Using
        Dynamator as part of an internationalization architecture
        can also result in more efficient runtime
        performance.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Easier support for multiple interfaces.</b><br />
         Dynamator simplifies development and maintenance of
        multi-channel and multi-customer applications. With
        Dynamator, a single copy of the server code can support
        any number of HTML- and XML-based interfaces.<br />
        <br />
