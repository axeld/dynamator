          Bug fixes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bug 1003120: Rename of tag for which HTML expects no
            end tag results in no end tag. All tag-specific processing
            now uses the renamed tag name; prior behavior was
            inconsistent. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Bug 990054: Comment divs with content overrides result in
            empty content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Made PHP escape consistent everywhere: '&lt;?php'.
            In several places (notably the Dynamator generation
            signature) it was simply '&lt;?', which was not 
            considered valid by XML validators.
          </li>
          <li>
            Corrected HTML for documentation banner to render
            properly in Netscape.
          </li>
        </ul>

        v 1.5 (2004/03/29)
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          New Features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Added Dynamator file validation. Validation is the
            default behavior; to disable, use 'dynamate -V' 
            (or in ant, 'validate="false"').
          </li>
          <li>
            Added &lt;extract&gt; modifier to support recursion and
            fragment reuse. The &lt;extract&gt; modifier moves the
            associated element and its children to the file
            specified by the 'to-file' attribute, or to the end of
            the current file, immediately before the epilog. Added
            &lt;before-extracts&gt; and &lt;after-extracts&gt;
            low-level elements to specify code to be placed around
            the set of extracts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added dynamate option '-F[<i>file</i>]' (ant attribute 'dynfile')
            to specify the Dynamator file to be applied to template
            files instead of using name matching.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Removed Features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Removed <b>dynamator:copy</b>. This was a problematic
            feature. Syntactically, it didn't belong with the rest of
            the language (as might be inferred from the name).
            Its implementation added significant complexity,
            and had a high performance cost. And when I searched my
            catalog of Dynamator applications, I found no remaining
            uses. 
            <p>
              If you need this feature, please 
              <a href="http://sourceforge.net/users/jaydunning"
              class="offsite">send me</a> a description of how you are
              using it. 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Enhancements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Documentation changes:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Made download documentation identical to the website.
                Source for the website is now stored in CVS, as is the
                process used to create the website.
              </li>
              <li>
                Integrated the tutorial into the website.
                The tutorial now requires a browser that supports
                iframes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Revised the tutorial to eliminate tutorial.jar.
              </li>
              <li>
                Moved Changes.html (this file) and Install.html
                to the documentation directory.
              </li>
              <li>
                Converted the website to XHTML.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            (Patch 896127, Chris Felaco) Implemented major
            performance enhancements and refactorings based on this
            patch: 
            <ul>
              <li>
                Language-specific factory classes have been removed.
                After several years of evolution, Annotations objects
                are no longer language-specific. Factory behavior has
                therefore been moved to Generator, which is by
                nature language-specific. Generator prototypes are
                cached and cloned.
              </li>
              <li>
                The priming Dynamator file read has been removed,
                since creation of Annotations objects no longer
                requires knowledge of the language.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dynamator directives automatically added for
                body-only HTML (-B) are now inserted
                programmatically via the DOM. Previously they were
                stored in a string and parsed for each file.
              </li>
              <li>
                Included files are now cached. Since most projects
                use a set of included files throughout all
                Dynamator files, and document inclusion is
                expensive, this has a major impact. In testing with
                my current real-world application, this single
                change cut Dynamator processing time by 40%. (YMMV)
              </li>
              <li>
                Dynamator file elements are now accessed via
                indices rather than sequentially. In my tests, this
                change cut Dynamator processing time by 25%. (YMMV)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            This change impacts the plugin interface.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Added Taxonomy example showing recursive invocation
            using the 'extract' feature (or, in the case of JSP, an
            inline class).
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved internal resource management so that Dynamator
            can be used within a long-running task.
          </li>
          <li>
            For templates declaring an XHTML doctype, elements that
            have an empty content model are now output using
            minimized tag syntax (e.g. &lt;br /&gt;).
          </li>
          <li>
            Enhanced the ant task to create the output directory if
            it doesn't already exist.
          </li>
          <li>
            Execution is now terminated in all cases when Tidy
            detects errors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changed error output to omit "execution terminated"
            message.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added 'final' declaration specifier to variables
            declared by Dynamator for language="java", to appease
            Checkstyle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved examples structure a bit: generated files are
            now placed in a subdirectory ('generated'); added
            overall build.xml and Makefile, improved ant clean
            targets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrated ant task logging behavior with ant. 'ant -v'
            and 'ant -debug' now work as expected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Moved dynamator.jar in release file from 'lib' directory to
            root directory. 
          </li>
          <li>
            (Internal) Most tests are now whitespace-sensitive,
            allowing whitespace errors to be detected.
          </li>
          <li>
            (Internal) Added some tests for invalid input.
          </li>
          <li>
            (Internal) Added compile step to regression test for
            language=java to make sure generated code is valid
            Java. Fixed compiler errors in TextEcho2 example.
          </li>
          <li>
            (Internal) Removed build dependency on sed and diff.
            Build and regression testing now require <a
            href="http://ant.apache.org">ant</a> 1.5.3-1, <a
            href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net">
            ant-contrib</a> and, under JDKs earlier than 1.4, <a
            href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/">jakarta-oro</a>.
            Regression testing is a little more awkward, since
            there's no diff for ant.
          </li>
          <li>
            (Internal) Revised build to conform to best practices:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Most generated files are now placed under the 'build'
                directory.  
              </li>
              <li>
                Project properties may now be overridden through
                user-defined properties files. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Build scripts now directly reference the Dynamator jar
                instead of expecting it to be in the classpath. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Added dynamator-build-libs download to provide all
            libraries used to build Dynamator. (Ant, PMD, JSDK, 
            and JCoverage are not included.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Added CONTRIBUTORS.txt to acknowledge contributors.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Bug fixes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For language=none, moved the file generation comment to
            end of file, to prevent <a
            href="http://gutfeldt.ch/matthias/articles/doctypeswitch.html">
            browser quirk mode</a> caused by outputting it at the
            beginning of the file.
          </li>
          <li>
            For language=xsl, moved the file generation comment to
            end of file, to allow generated files to begin with 
            the XML processing instruction.
          </li>
          <li>
            For body-only HTML, eliminated output of DOCTYPE,
            CDATA, and processing instructions appearing outside
            the body.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ignore contents of comments within Dynamator file. When
            a Dynamator file comment contained a partial element of
            interest to Dynamator (e.g. a start tag without an end
            tag), a parse error would result.
          </li>
          <li>
            For language="java", eliminated occasional spurious
            output of the text <tt>");</tt>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Made significant improvements in whitespace handling.
            In most cases, whitespace in generated file should
            match template (or .asxml file) whitespace, when
            indentation is accounted for. 
            <ul>
              <li>
                Eliminated whitespace around emitted content within
                an if block. This was a potential source of the <a
                href="http://www.emf.net/~estephen/htmlner/whitespacebugs.html">
                browser whitespace bug</a>. This change eliminates
                whitespace even when the whitespace would have been
                OK, decreasing the readability of emitted content
                in those cases. But correct browser rendering is a
                higher priority than (generated) source code
                readability. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Indentation is no longer applied to CDATA content.
                (Whitespace within CDATA is significant.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Whitespace is no longer discarded between elements
                that are separated only by spaces and/or tabs. The
                HTML sequence "&lt;/x&gt; \n\t &lt;y&gt;" had been
                rendered "&lt;/x&gt;&lt;y&gt;"; it is now rendered
                "&lt;/x&gt; &lt;y&gt;".
              </li>
              <li>
                Eliminated the addition of white space between
                element tags and text data outside the element. For
                example, '.&lt;span&gt;' was rendered
                '.\n&lt;span&gt;'.
              </li>
              <li>
                For non-template languages like Java, terminate
                program lines before emitting the content of
                &lt;before&gt; and &lt;raw-content&gt; elements.
              </li>
              <li>
                For language=java, remove end-of-lines after
                conditionally output flag attributes.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Execution is now terminated when Tidy detects a missing
            &lt;/script&gt; tag. This is required because Tidy treats
            this as a recoverable error: it tries to fix the
            problem by escaping all subsequent tags.
          </li>
          <li>
            Corrected several bugs in trace output handling. When
            outputting to a file under Ant, the trace output file
            was overwritten for each template file processed. The
            output writer was buffered but never closed, so in some
            implementations the end of the buffer may not have been
            written to the file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Revised code that prevented compilation under JDK 1.1.
          </li>
        </ul>

      </dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Beefed up unit tests to bring test coverage to 80% line
            coverage. Untested code is mostly error handling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Removed dependency on Xerces. Tested with the XML
            parser included with JDK 1.4.1. For JDK releases prior
            to 1.4, Xerces is still recommended, since Dynamator
            requires both a SAX and a DOM parser. Dynamator uses
            the standard JAXP facility for identifying the parser
            implementation (see the documentation for
            javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory).
          </li>
          <li>
            Corrected bug in raw-attr processing for
            language="java": if raw-attr contained a quote, the
            quote was not escaped. This will break current files
            that accommodated for this by adding an escape.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cleaned up body-only HTML output: Removed &lt;!DOCTYPE
            ...&gt; directives and comments outside of body.
          </li>
          <li>
            Caused attribute values containing quotes to be output
            within single quotes. No support yet for attribute
            values containing both quotes and single quotes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Corrected script processing (see change log for
            Dynamator 1.1). The content of each script element is
            now treated as CDATA, except for no-content span tags.
            Since Dynamator 1.1, Dynamator had tried to handle all
            span and div tags within script elements, but this was
            based on an incomplete understanding of the HTML syntax
            for script elements (the character sequence '&lt;/'
            terminates a script element). A review of the use cases
            concluded that the only reason for processing elements
            within a script is variable replacement, which can be

            Some enhancements to Tidy message processing: 
            <ul>
              <li>
                Output only warning and error messages from JTidy,
                to make builds look cleaner. (Tidy does not provide
                the option to omit warning messages.)
              </li>
              <li>
                If error messages are found, output the file name
                before the error messages. (Tidy doesn't output the
                file name and Dynamator is usually used to process
                a set of files at a time.)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Properly handle class="Discard" and class="DiscardTag"
            for comment divs. (Previously, the comments were
            retained even when these were specified.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved performance of generated programs for
            language="java". Previously, each line was output using
            a single 'out.write(...)' statement. If a line
            contained a variable value, string concatenation was
            used within the output argument. Now, lines that
            contain variable values are split into multiple
            'out.write(...)' statements. Example: 
            <div class="column">
              <div class="neutral">
                Before
              </div>
              <div class="out">
<pre>
out.write("    &lt;p&gt;" + ( getGreeting() ) + "&lt;/p&gt;\n");
</pre>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="clear">
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <div class="neutral">
                After
              </div>
              <div class="out">
<pre>
out.write("    &lt;p&gt;");
    out.write(String.valueOf(getGreeting()));
    out.write("&lt;/p&gt;\n");
</pre>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="clear">
            </div>
            <p>
              (Thanks to Bill Field for ranting about the evils of
              String concatenation enough times that I finally
              realized I could do something about it in this case.)

          <li>
            (Internal) Commented out rcsID constant declarations in
            Dynamator source code. This retains the CVS file
            version ID in the source code, but removes them from
            the class files. The rcs ID string is not a definitive
            source of version information, since someone can update
            the source code without changing the ID string. (Thanks
            to Keith Ackley for pointing this out to me.)
          </li>
          <li>
            (Internal) Improved the tutorial generation process

            current code.

          </li>
          <li>
            Added ability to define div elements in template file
            comments to allow grouping of HTML elements where
            &lt;div&gt; tags would be invalid. This is especially
            useful within HTML tables to group rows or cells when
            the template requires more than one row or cell to be
            output for each element of a collection. For example: 
            <div class="column">
              <div class="html">
<pre>
&lt;table&gt;
  <b>&lt;!-- div id="row-group" --&gt;</b>

    &lt;tr class="delimiter-row"&gt;
      &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;
        &lt;img src="horizontal_line.png" height="1" width="100"&gt;

          <li>
            Added ability to insert a conditional expression within
            a for or foreach. The condition is evaluated for each
            iteration, and applies to the content of the element
            addressed by the foreach. Syntax: 
            <div class="column">
              <div class="dyn">
<pre>
&lt;foreach...&gt;
  <i>collection-expression</i>
  &lt;if&gt;<i>conditional-expression</i>&lt;/if&gt;
&lt;/foreach...&gt;
</pre>
              </div>

            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Added <tt>-t</tt> option to specify the directory

            template</tt> attribute of the &lt;dynamator&gt;
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added <a href="http://ant.apache.org">ant</a>
            task: dynamator.ant.DynamateTask to allow Dynamator to
            be used from ant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changed internal build process to use ant. Examples now
            include both Makefile and ant build.xml files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added ability to specify multiple replacements of the
            same attribute value string using syntax <code>
            [[@/a/b/+/c/d/+/e/f/...]]</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Removed several causes of the dreaded <a
            href="http://www.emf.net/~estephen/htmlner/whitespacebugs.html">
            browser whitespace bug</a>. Disabled line wrapping in
            Tidy (wrap=0), made most scriptlets start immediately
            following previous text (without an intervening
            newline), and eliminated whitespace before and after
            &lt;before{-content}&gt; and &lt;after{-content}&gt;
            element content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Corrected bug that prevented without-attrs from working
            if more than one attribute name was specified.
          </li>
          <li>
            Corrected handling of overrides to content of discarded
            template elements. If a template element's content is
            discarded (i.e. using &lt;discard/&gt; or
            class="Discard", any overrides that might result in it
            having content are ignored. This includes overrides
            that apply directly to the content of the discarded
            element (&lt;content&gt;, &lt;raw-content&gt;,
            &lt;before-content&gt;, &lt;after-content&gt;), as well
            as all overrides to child elements. Previously,
            overrides were generated even when content was
            discarded.
          </li>
          <li>
            Corrected several bugs associated with the Trace
            feature: one that occasionally resulted in an
            exception, one that resulted in improper indentation
            for discarded elements, and one caused by line lengths
            greater than 999. Also slightly improved Trace messages
            for discarded elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Corrected handling of DOS file paths. Previously, if
            the template filename contained backlashes, an error
            would result (with the confusing message, "Annotations
            file not found").
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved handling of &lt;/textarea&gt; tags by
            preventing the output formatter from adding preceding
            whitespace, which caused trailing blanks in textarea
            fields when indentation was enabled.

          <li>
            Deprecated sequenced &lt;foreach&gt; element. (The
            collection version of &lt;foreach&gt; is still
            available.) The new &lt;for&gt; element is simpler to
            use. The primary motivator for deprecation was that
            compare expressions often contain a '&lt;', which had
            to be written as '&amp;lt;' because it appeared within
            an attribute.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added '-B' option to generate body-only HTML. This
            allows HTML fragments to be input as templates. Without
            -B, Tidy ensures that HTML files contain &lt;html&gt;,
            &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt; elements. Fragments are
            useful for dynamic assembly of site content using
            server page inclusion facilities.

          <li>
            Added 'without-attr' to Dynamator &lt;tag&gt; element.

            directory: the directory containing the original

                Allow XML parser to see XML processing instructions
                in Dynamator file when they occur before the
                &lt;dynamator&gt; element. This allows Dynamator
                files to specify XML encoding.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transcode HTML input files that are not in an
                encoding understood by JTidy into UTF-8, then
                transcode the JTidy output back to the original
                encoding.

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Dynamator has now been successfully tested with
            ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, and Big5. It is believed to work
            with any character encoding supported by both Java and
            Xerces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Retain HTML entities as originally written. Previously,
            Dynamator allowed JTidy to decide how to output HTML
            entities (such as <tt>&amp;nbsp;</tt> and <tt>
            &amp;#161;</tt>). This was confusing, because entities
            were often output in a different form. Worse, for most
            non-Ascii character encodings, JTidy outputs entities
            as raw characters. Now, Dynamator obfuscates all HTML
            <tt>&amp;</tt> characters so that JTidy cannot
            recognize them. This allows entities to pass through
            unchanged. A side-effect of this change is that JTidy
            cannot correct any errors in entity coding, such as
            unknown entities and missing terminating semicolons. To
            prevent propagation of entity encoding errors, HTML
            files should be validated with Tidy before processing
            with Dynamator.
          </li>
          <li>
            Correctly support HTML &lt;script&gt; elements. These
            elements are now treated as CDATA by the parser, so
            that special characters such as <tt>&lt;</tt> (as in
            <tt>x &lt; y</tt>) don't cause the parser to fail. As a
            side-effect of this change, only &lt;span&gt; and
            &lt;div&gt; tags within a script are recognized by
            Dynamator.

          <li>
            Allow multiple prologs and epilogs. Each is inserted in
