      Extending Dynamator to support new languages

        <p>
          Dynamator is designed to be easily extended to support
          new languages. There's no comprehensive guide; you'll
          have to look around the source code to figure things out.
          But the existing language extensions should provide
          sufficient examples.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Determine which currently implemented language is most
            like the target language. Dynamator/JSP should provide
            a superset of the functionality needed for most
            XML/template-based languages; Dynamator/Java should
            provide a model for most traditional languages and for
            line-oriented template languages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Copy the source directory of the example language into
            a directory named for the target language. (The
            language-specific source directory trees are in the
            source distribution under .../languages/dynamator.) So,
            for example, if you've determined that JSP is the
            closest language to your language PUFF, create
            directory .../languages/dynamator/puff and copy
            .../languages/dynamator/jsp/* to
            .../languages/dynamator/puff.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hack up the source code so that it does what you want.
            For any language, only one class is required: a class
            called "Generator".
          </li>
          <li>
            No changes to the Dynamator core should be required.
          </li>
          <li>
            You should be able to access your language-specific
            module by creating a Dynamator file that specifies
            your language name as the language in the dynamator
            element: &lt;dynamator language="puff"&gt;.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </dd>
