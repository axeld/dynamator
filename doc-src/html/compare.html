    <h2>
      Comparison Criteria and Comments
    </h2>
    <p>
      The table above compares Dynamator with popular Java
      technologies claiming to separate program logic from static
      content, using the following criteria:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        HTML purity and validity
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
        Can the technology use pure HTML without the addition of
        server-side program logic? 
        Can someone knowledgeable only in
        HTML and web applications in general develop and maintain HTML
        templates that can be used without modification by this
        technology?
        Given an HTML marked up to use this technology, would an HTML
        validator consider it valid? 
        </p>
        <p>
          Dynamator and XMLC use the same HTML interface,
          leveraging the HTML standard. Tapestry is nearly pure,
          but requires a non-standard attribute. The others
          aren't even close.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Architectural neutrality
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
        Are web applications that use this technology free to
        choose any server-side presentation architecture without
        constraint? (Note that a negative in this category is not
        necessarily a bad thing, if you can commit to a single
        architecture across an application portfolio.)
        </p>
        <p>
          With a much larger scope than any of the other products
          listed, Tapestry is on the opposite end of this
          spectrum from Dynamator, which is a small tool that
          focuses on doing one thing without imposing architectural
          constraints. 
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Supports non-web applications
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
        Can the technology be used with applications that run
        outside a servlet container? Can the technology be used
        for a command-line application without mock servlet
        scaffolding?  
        </p>
        <p>
          Dynamator, Velocity, and XMLC can be used with batch
          programs for document generation.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Language independence
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
        Does the technology assume Java, or can it work with other
        languages as well?
        </p>
        <p>
          JSP theoretically supports multiple languages, but
          in practice works only with Java.
          Because Dynamator is specifically designed for use with
          multiple languages, it can supply a degree of consistency to
          a multi-technology portfolio. For example, Dynamator can be
          used to generate JSP, servlets, and XSL.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Freedom from run-time components
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
        Is it possible to run an application that uses this
        technology without deploying a technology-specific
        run-time library?
        </p>
        <p>
          Dynamator doesn't require any run-time library, because
          Dynamator executes in the development environment.
          Generated pages or programs stand on their own.
          This makes for a simpler execution environment,
          simplifies debugging, and reduces tool dependence.  
          If you run into a problem with an output library component,
          you don't have many options.  If you run into a problem with
          Dynamator, you can always tweak the generated source code.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Efficient run-time
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
        Is the technology as efficient as a hand-coded program
        containing out.println statements?
        </p>
        <p>
          All of these technologies claim to be "efficient enough".
          But it's hard to match Dynamator for efficiency, since
          it has a run-time overhead of zero. (Java code generated by 
          Dynamator may actually be more efficient than a hand-coded
          program that uses string concatenation.)
          This is one of Dynamator's biggest advantages over XMLC.
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <br/>
    <p>Note:
      Even though they appear as competitors in the chart above,
      Dynamator can generate JSP (scripts or taglibs) and Velocity.
      Although it's often better to just generate straight Java.
